  # Hudi maintains a timeline of all actions performed on the table at
    different **'instants' of time that helps provide instantaneous views of the table,
    while also efficiently supporting retrieval of data in the order of arrival

  # Hudi guarantees that the actions performed on the timeline are atomic &
    timeline consistent based on the instant time
